# Covid_SARS
Research project from University of Toronto course Introduction to Databases CSC343.

We use SQL and online databases to answer the following questions:

1. How do global factors, such as GDP, HDI, and population density compare between countries that experienced the highest Covid case rates and countries who experienced the lowest COVID case rates?
Which factors differ greatly, meaning that they have a high likelihood of significantly impacting COVID cases, and which factors do not differ much at all? How do these factors compare to the averages from all countries? 

  Follow-up question: SARS, a strain of COVID, is a respiratory illness responsible for the outbreak during 2002-2004. For countries that experienced the highest COVID rates, did they also experience the highest SARS rates? 

2. Various countries suffer from different amounts of COVID-19 cases. How can we determine a country's proactivity in dealing with the virus?
We can use two measures: vaccine-to-case ratio and test-to-case ratio. If a country has a high vaccine-to-case ratio and a high test-to-case ratio, this means that they are proactive with respect to preventative actions and diagnostic actions.
Intuitively, if a country takes COVID-19 seriously, these two ratios will be high.

  Investigative question: Certain countries experienced extremely high single-day spikes in COVID-19 cases. How seriously were these countries treating the COVID-19 pandemic situation before the single-day spike?

3. For countries that experienced significant infrastructure changes from the period of SARS to the period of COVID through factors such as GDP and Health Expenditure,
do these changes translate into better preparation for COVID through factors like hospital beds, life expectancy, death rate?
